# A material that includes a texture map showing how a texture may be scaled
# left or right (in the "u" direction) or up and down (in the "v" direction).
# The material color is set to "ident" to preserve the texture's true color.
#
# In this example, the original image of the logo is too small. To compensate,
# the texture is scaled slightly to the right (in the positive "u" direction)
# and up (in the positive "v" direction) using the "-s" option to modify the
# scale.
#
# Example taken from the MTL specification.
