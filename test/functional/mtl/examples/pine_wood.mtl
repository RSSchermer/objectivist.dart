# A material that includes a texture map of a pine pattern. The material color
# is set to "ident" to preserve the texture's true color. When applied to an
# object, this texture map will affect only the ambient and diffuse regions of
# that object's surface.
#
# The color information for the texture is stored in a separate .mpc file that
# is referred to in the material by its name, "pine.mpc". If you use different
# .mpc files for ambient and diffuse, you will get unrealistic results.
#
# Example taken from the MTL specification.
