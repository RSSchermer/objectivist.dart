# A material that includes a texture map which illustrates how a texture's
# origin may be shifted left/right (the "u" direction) or up/down (the "v"
# direction). The material color is set to "ident" to preserve the texture's
# true color.
#
# In this example, the original image of the logo is off-center to the left. To
# compensate, the texture's origin is shifted back to the right (the positive
# "u" direction) using the "-o" option to modify the origin.
#
# Example taken from the MTL specification.
