# A material that includes a texture map used to alter the opacity of an
# object's surface. The material color is set to "ident" to preserve the
# texture's true color. When applied to an object, the object becomes
# transparent in certain areas and opaque in others.
#
# The variation between opaque and transparent regions is controlled by scalar
# information stored in a separate .mps file that is referred to in the material
# by its name, "window.mps". The "-mm" option is used to shift and compress the
# range of opacity.
#
# Example taken from the MTL specification.
