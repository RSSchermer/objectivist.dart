# objects that are seen through it. Filtering is done according to the
# transmission color of the material. The material also distorts the image of
# objects according to its optical density. Note that the material is not
# dissolved and that its ambient, diffuse, and specular reflective colors have
# been set to black. Only the transmission color is non-black.
