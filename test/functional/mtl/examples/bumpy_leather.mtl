# A material that includes a texture map of a leather pattern. The material
# color is set to "ident" to preserve the texture's true color. When applied to
# an object, it affects both the color of the object's surface and its apparent
# bumpiness.
#
# The color information for the texture is stored in a separate .mpc file that
# is referred to in the material by its name, "brown.mpc". The bump information
# is stored in a separate .mpb file that is referred to in the material by its
# name, "leath.mpb". The -bm option is used to raise the apparent height of the
# leather bumps.
#
# Example taken from the MTL specification.
